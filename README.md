# Google Travel Hotel pricing Scraping

## Features

- CSV Input: Reads data from a CSV file where the input values (such as dates) can be stored.
- Date Filling: Automatically fills check-in and check-out date fields on web forms.
- Web Scraping: Uses Playwright to interact with web elements and extract data.
